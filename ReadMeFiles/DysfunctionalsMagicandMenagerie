Magic is cool, magic is great, and exploring is even cooler. Combining structures, magic, and dragons (Who invited them, not even I know!), our coding monkeys at Dysfunctional Ent. have been hard at work making this modpack.

In this modpack, you'll need to gather several different resources of varying complexity to gain ultimate power! From the fabled flux sponge capable of cleaning reality, to the mana pool of guilt, to several other items that need twice the resources of the last to make!  
  
Now, go, explore, and discover what these items are, and how they work!
